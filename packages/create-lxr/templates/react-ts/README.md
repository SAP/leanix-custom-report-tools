# LeanIX Custom Report

A minimal custom report starter template showcasing LeanIX Reporting SDK basics.

## Features

- Fetches Applications from LeanIX workspace
- Groups applications by lifecycle phase
- Displays interactive bar chart with Chart.js
- Clean separation of concerns (UI, visualization)
- TypeScript for type safety

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

**Important:** Create a `lxr.json` file in the project root with your LeanIX workspace credentials:

```json
{
  "host": "your-workspace.leanix.net",
  "apitoken": "your-api-token"
}
```

Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The report will run against your LeanIX workspace configured in `lxr.json`.

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── App.tsx           # Main component with data logic and LeanIX configuration
├── BarChart.tsx      # Chart.js visualization component
├── App.css           # Styles
└── main.tsx          # Application entry point
```

## Build

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Output will be in the `dist/` folder.

## Upload to LeanIX

Upload the report to your LeanIX workspace:

```bash
npm run upload
```

This builds and uploads the report using credentials from `lxr.json`.

## Customization

### Change What Data to Fetch

Edit the `attributes` array in `src/App.tsx`:

```typescript
attributes: ['id', 'displayName', 'lifecycle { asString }']
```

### Modify the Visualization

Edit `src/App.tsx` to change how data is grouped and displayed.

Edit `src/BarChart.tsx` to customize the Chart.js configuration.

### Query Different Fact Sheet Types

Change `fixedFactSheetType` in `src/App.tsx`:

```typescript
fixedFactSheetType: 'BusinessCapability' // or 'Project', 'ITComponent', etc.
```
